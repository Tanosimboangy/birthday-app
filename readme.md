#   **My experience:**

    -  Since this project is based upon Javascript, displaying each item can be complicated.

    - After fetching the data from the json file, I displayed the them and translated all of the numeric number into readable date.

    - I mirrored and stored all the data into the local storage, this is quite useful so that you do not need to fetch everytime.

    - Apart from that, I created a function called `destryoPopup`, which is responsible for removing the class open.

    - After all, I have this `editFunction` which is in charge of handling all the edits the user is doing.

    - Then, the delete fuction, in which I managed to delete one of the items. By clicking the delete icon, you can delete one items from the lists.

    - On top of that, I have a form in which you can add a new list of a person. Just click the add somebody button and the form will appear so that you can add the details for the new person.

#   **In a few sentences, explain the structure of my project:**
    - Lately, I tried to use parcel to run the run this code to the browser.

    - There are one input which you can filter the lists by typing the name of the person. The select can help you to search a specific person according to its birthday date, the month.

    - You can click the `Add Somebody` button so that you can add a new person into the lists.

    - In each item, we can see two icons: the edit icon, which you can click in order to edit the information about the person on that specific list. There is also a delete icon that you can click in order to remove one person from the lists.

## Anything new I learn while working on this project:
    - I learn to use another strategy to get the date from using the number. I tried to use date.fns and it worked. 

## The most challenging part for me were:
    - I had a lot of difficulty while trying to translate the number into dates, especially with using this library called `date.fns`.

    - I also spent most of my time to handle the form.

    - I struggled a lot when I stored all of the data into Local Storage
